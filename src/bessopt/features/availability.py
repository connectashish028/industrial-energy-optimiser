"""Per-column data-availability rules.

This module encodes a single source of truth for *when* each kind of column in
the SMARD master frame is known to a forecaster issuing predictions at issue
time T. The leakage tests in `tests/test_no_leakage.py` rely on these rules.

The rules are categorical, keyed by column-name prefix, because the SMARD
column convention is consistent:

    actual_cons__*     — measured consumption, ground truth.
    actual_gen__*      — measured generation by source.
    fc_cons__*         — TSO day-ahead consumption forecast (published ~D-1 10:00 CET).
    fc_gen__*          — TSO day-ahead generation forecast (published ~D-1 10:00 CET).
    price__*           — exchange day-ahead clearing prices (published ~D-1 12:45 CET).
    weather__*         — Open-Meteo NWP forecast at issue time. By construction
                         (the `historical-forecast` API returns the most recent
                         issued forecast), values for any timestamp `ts` reflect
                         a forecast that pre-dates `ts`. We treat them as
                         "forecast" (visible up to T + 48h).

The forecaster's issue time T is fixed at D-1 12:00 Europe/Berlin.

Availability semantics — a column's value at row timestamp `ts` is "available
at issue time T" iff:

    ACTUAL_*       :  ts < T                   (no future actuals, ever)
    FC_*           :  ts < T + 36h             (TSO publishes the full day-D
                                                series before T; the +36h cap
                                                is a defensive belt-and-braces
                                                covering D 00:00 -> D+1 00:00
                                                Berlin local in any timezone.)
    PRICE_*        :  ts < T + 12h             (Prices for delivery day D
                                                clear ~D-1 12:45, after T.
                                                But prices for delivery D-1
                                                (auctioned at D-2 12:00,
                                                published D-2 12:45) ARE
                                                known at T. So timestamps
                                                up to D 00:00 Berlin = T + 12h
                                                are usable.)
    OTHER          :  ts < T                   (default to the strictest rule.)
