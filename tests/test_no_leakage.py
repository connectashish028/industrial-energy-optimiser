"""Leakage tests for the feature pipeline (Milestone 2).

The single most important set of tests in the project. If a feature value
silently depends on data from after the issue time, every later evaluation
will look better than reality and the whole project's headline number is
worthless.

Two complementary approaches are used:

1. **Per-column rule check.** Every raw column is classified by
   `availability.classify_column` and the rule says when its values become
   knowable. We sample issue times across the dataset and verify the rule
   masks future values correctly.

2. **Corrupt-future test (the strong one).** Build features at issue time T.
   Then take the same DataFrame, scramble every actual value at index >= T
   (and every price value at index >= T - 12h), and rebuild features. The
   rebuilt features must match the originals bit-for-bit. If they don't,
   *some* future value is leaking into a feature.
